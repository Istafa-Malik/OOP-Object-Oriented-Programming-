Write a C++ program that stores the data of football players on a team. It should store Player’s First name, Last name, Number of goals scored, age and ranking.

Store the data of all team members in an array.

Make functions to add, update, search and display a player’s data.

The program should be menu driven i.e. user should be given various choices

1-Add new player
2-Update a  Player’s record
3-Search Player
4-Display complete list of players
5-Exit the program.
The program has limited memory so values to the functions should be passed by reference using pointers.

The Search function should take a player’s name or index as input and should return the details of that specific player.

The program should only end when user press 5, otherwise it should function according to the user’s choice.
